Revision history for Perl extension MarpaX::Demo::JSONParser.

1.07  Unreleased.
	- Add github repo to Makefile.PL.

1.06  Sun Aug 31 09:12:00 2014
	- Add data/json.3.bfn, Jeffrey Kegler's latest grammar, which uses MarpaX::Simple.
	- Modify JSONParser.pm code to use MarpaX::Simple. Modify the Synopsis to match the new demo.pl.
	- Update the docs in various ways.
	- Modify scripts/demo.pl to handle Marpa exceptions more cleanly.
	- Update pre-reqs to use Marpa::R2 V 2.091, and MarpaX::Simple V 0.03.
	- Fix bug in scripts/find.grammars.pl, which still only looked for json.1.bnf.

1.05  Sat Feb 22 17:44:00 2014
	- Add 'lexeme default = latm => 1' to the grammar.
	- Make V 2.082 the minimum version for Marpa::R2.

1.04  Mon Jan 20 08:33:00 2014
	- Correct docs: Jean-Damien Durand authored MarpaX::Languages::C::AST, but Peter Stuifzand
		authored json.1.bnf. This reverses the faulty correction in V 1.02. My apologies to Peter.

1.03  Thu Aug 22 12:44:00 2013
	- Fix a couple of typos in 'See Also'.
	- Add Test::Exception to the pre-reqs.

1.02  Tue Aug 20 08:13:00 2012
	- In t/basic.test.t, put quotes around giant integers, so Perl compares them as strings.
		CPAN testers are getting errors like this:
		     $got->{id} = '281405942321532929'
		$expected->{id} = '2.81405942321533e+017'
	- Add README file.
	- Correct docs: Jean-Damien Durand authored json.1.bnf and MarpaX::Languages::C::AST, not Peter Stuifzand.

1.01  Sat Aug 17 09:34:00 2013
	- Replace Peter's JSON grammar with one using spaces (from his original gist). I had used tabs.
	- Move the grammars from data/*.bnf to share/*.bnf. This, together with adopting File::ShareDir and
		Module::Install, means these files are installed in a shared directory when the source code is installed.
	- Add scripts/find.grammars.pl to print the path to the installed grammars json.1.bnf and json.2.bnf.
	- Add scripts/demo.pl to actually use the module, and copy its source into the Synopsis.

1.00  Mon Jul  1 14:14:00 2013
	- Initial version.
