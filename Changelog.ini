- In t/basic.test.t, put quotes around giant integers, so Perl compares them as strings.
CPAN testers are getting errors like this:
$got->{id} = '281405942321532929'
$expected->{id} = '2.81405942321533e+017'
- Add README file.
- Correct docs: Jean-Damien Durand authored json.1.bnf and MarpaX::Languages::C::AST, not Peter Stuifzand.

Comments= <<EOT
- Replace Peter's JSON grammar with one using spaces (from his original gist). I had used tabs.
- Move the grammars from data/*.bnf to share/*.bnf. This, together with adopting File::ShareDir and
Module::Install, means these files are installed in a shared directory when the source code is installed.
- Add scripts/find.grammars.pl to print the path to the installed grammars json.1.bnf and json.2.bnf.
- Add scripts/demo.pl to actually use the module, and copy its source into the Synopsis.
