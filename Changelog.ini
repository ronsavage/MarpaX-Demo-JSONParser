- Replace Peter's JSON grammar with one using spaces (from his original gist). I had used tabs.
- Move the grammars from data/*.bnf to share/*.bnf. This, together with adopting File::ShareDir and
Module::Install, means these files are installed in a shared directory when the source code is installed.
